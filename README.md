# Window
This is a simple C++ program that draws a rectangular window alternately with "#" and "$" characters and an empty interior. The program prompts the user to enter the width and height of the window, and then prints the window on the screen in the form of a character grid, with the window borders filled alternately with "#" and "$" characters. The interior of the window is left empty and filled with space characters " ".
